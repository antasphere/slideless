/**
 * OAuth Bearer-JWT resolution — the third credential path in auth-context.
 *
 * Access tokens are RS256 JWTs this instance minted itself (Better Auth jwt +
 * oauthProvider plugins), so verification is fully local: JWKS straight from
 * the jwt plugin (DB-backed, no HTTP), hard issuer / audience / algorithm /
 * expiry pinning. On top of the signature, every request re-resolves the
 * workspace membership LIVE — deactivating a member cuts token access on
 * their next request, not at token expiry. Scope enforcement stays in the
 * fail-closed allowlist gate (middleware/scopes.ts), identical to API keys.
 *
 * User-scoped credential model: a token identifies its USER ("act as you")
 * and carries NO workspace authority — claims are never an authorization
 * input. The request's target workspace comes from the X-Workspace-Id
 * selector through the shared resolveMembership rule (explicit → fail-closed
 * membership check; absent → the user's default, else oldest active), the
 * same rule sessions and API keys use.
