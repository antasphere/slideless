 * post-resolution in authContext, not here). What changes is the ADVERTISED
 * entrance (D1, hub-only human login):
 *
 *  - `antasphere` replaces password/email-otp/google — the login page
 *    renders ONLY "Sign in with Antasphere". The local password machinery
 *    stays WIRED (hidden, not blocked): the break-glass CLI remains the
 *    operator door, and blocking /sign-in/email would dead-end it.
 *  - `passwordReset`/`emailChange` are off: credentials and email are the
 *    HUB's to manage (D10 re-syncs email at every login); a local reset
 *    surface would fight the sync. Since the P8 close (ADR 017) the reset
 *    routes don't just report false — they REFUSE on cloud (403; the
 *    before-hook in identity/better-auth.ts + the members reset-link mint),
 *    so a hub-JIT user can never SET a local password and sidestep SSO.
 *  - `twoFactor` is off: the second factor guards local password/OTP
 *    sign-ins, which the cloud page no longer offers — MFA is the hub's
 *    concern at its own login.
