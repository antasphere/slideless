/**
 * POST /workspaces — a signed-in person creates ANOTHER workspace from inside
 * the product (PRDCT-2444 self-hosted, PRDCT-2443 cloud). ADR 014 kept this
 * door shut in the template ("workspace creation is a product decision");
 * this module is that decision, taken.
 *
 * One route, two editions:
 *  - oss: `WorkspaceService.create` (the setup path) under a per-user
 *    advisory lock + the operator's `MAX_WORKSPACES_PER_USER` cap — the
 *    hub's `POST /orgs` model, mirrored.
 *  - cloud: the organization is created AT THE HUB as the caller (their own
 *    stored grant, ADR 019 — no service key, no target-user parameter), then
 *    the caller's reconcile is forced so the local projection and the
 *    `origin='hub'` owner membership exist before the answer. The answer
 *    carries the LOCAL workspace id.
 *
 * SESSIONS ONLY, twice: the path is deliberately UNLISTED in the fail-closed
 * machine scope allowlist (middleware/scopes.ts — never list it), and the
 * handler re-checks `via === 'session'` itself. /mcp carries no tool for it.
 *
 * A WORKSPACE NEVER LEARNS WHAT ITS MEMBERS DO ELSEWHERE: the route is
 * exempt from the generic audit middleware (which would attribute the event
 * to the workspace the person happened to be in) and writes its one genesis
 * row, `workspace.create`, into the NEW workspace's own trail — the setup
 * pattern. The idempotency claim is the only trace left in the caller's
 * current scope, and it is a sealed replay cache, never a readable surface.
