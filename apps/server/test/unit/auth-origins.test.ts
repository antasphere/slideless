/**
 * PRDCT-1352, the auth-layer second locks. The host gate keeps the auth
 * surface off the viewer hostname and the cross-site guard refuses the viewer
 * Origin before Better Auth ever runs — so these two arms are only reachable
 * once BOTH have regressed. That is exactly why they must be pinned on their
 * own: the verifier proved that with gate + guard bypassed, dropping the
 * sign-in arm turns a viewer-origin sign-in from 403 into 200 + Set-Cookie.
