-- SL-6 backfill: every user existing at deploy is marked already-dismissed —
-- the first-run welcome belongs to users whose FIRST login happens after
-- this ships; nobody gets a retroactive banner. New users get their row
-- (dismissed_at NULL = welcome owed) from the login path's lazy insert.
-- ON CONFLICT keeps the backfill re-runnable and never clobbers a row the
-- login path already wrote.
